				    	<p>Equipped with the revolutionary MicroWorld Winsock Layer (MWL) Technology, eScan detects information security threats at the Windows socket layer itself, before it reaches the Application Layer, thus preventing the applications from getting infected. With the Non-Intrusive Learning Pattern (NILP) that employs an adaptive mechanism in Spam and Phishing Control using Artificial Intelligence techniques. It learns the behavioral pattern of the user and classifies emails as Ham (wanted e-mails) or Spam (unwanted e-mails). The Domain and IP Reputation Checker (DIRC) checks the reputation of any suspicious Website or IP, and protects your computer against Phishing, Malware Infections, Objectionable Content, Network Intruders, and other cyber threats.</p>

				    	<p>eScan’s cloud-based Security Network provides fast response to the latest virus threats without waiting for daily or traditional virus signature updates using global threat intelligence engine.</p>
